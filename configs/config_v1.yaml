  # --- MODEL CONFIGURATION ---
  model:
    max_lag: 12              # Increased memory for the past to capture longer-term variations
    n_hidden_units: 32       # More flexibility for complex variations

  sampling:
    n_chains: 6             # More chains for better exploration
    n_adapt: 4000           # Much longer adaptation for stability across variations
    n_burnin: 800
    n_keep: 2000            # More samples to better reflect variability
