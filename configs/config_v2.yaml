  # --- MODEL CONFIGURATION ---
  model:
    max_lag: 0              # No lag memory - no temporal dynamics
    n_hidden_units: 1       # Almost no learning capacity
    n_fourier_nodes: 0      # No seasonality
    n_spline_knots: 1       # No trend flexibility

  # --- MCMC SAMPLING ---
  sampling:
    n_chains: 1             # Minimal exploration, random noise
    n_adapt: 50             # Almost no adaptation
    n_burnin: 10
    n_keep: 10              # Very few samples for noise & instability
